# my-custom-token-built-on-polygon

#### Built a polygon token with following features as part of my weekend assignment: 

🔺 Mintable

🔺 Burnable 

🔺 Transferable and Ownership feature.

🔺 Tax transaction, Burn and Charity fee.

🔺 Providing Liquidity. 



### Let's look into few of the basic tokenomics I have done for this:

Token Name: Sephitron

Symbol: MR3

Token Supply: 3M

Decimal: 18


For this token (which is having a total supply of 3 million, Liquidity is done only for the first 10000 tokens on @SushiSwap)



### ✔️ Features modified and tested on Polygon Testnet 





For newbies, I will try to include most of the contracts for integrating certain features in your custom token. It's great to gather feature contract template files or can use OpenZeppelin or Moralis. Also you can go through the doc which I have attached for a easier way to implement.
