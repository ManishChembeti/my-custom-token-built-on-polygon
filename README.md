# my-custom-token-built-on-polygon

#### Built a polygon token with following features as part of my weekend assignment: 

🔺 Mintable

🔺 Burnable 

🔺 Pausable

🔺 Transferable and Ownership feature.

🔺 Tax transaction, Burn and Charity fee.

🔺 Providing Liquidity. 



### 📟 Let's look into few of the basic tokenomics I have done for this:


Token Name: Sephitron

Symbol: MR3

Token Supply: 3M

Decimal: 18

Block explorer: https://polygonscan.com


#### 🦊 My Metamask Polygon Mainnet Address: 0xD20d252AA46e7Fe9fD2F080Eee0D628FA09fF1b5

For this token (which is having a total supply of 3 million, Liquidity is done only for the first 10000 tokens on @SushiSwap).

A ERC20 token with deflationary system. Burn + Charity + Rewards

It will charge a fee on each transaction and this is divided in:

Burn fee
Charity fee
Holders reward fee
You can decide you own % for each fee.



### ✔️ Features modified and tested on Polygon Testnet

For newbies, I will try to include most of the contracts for integrating certain features in your custom token. It's great to gather feature contract template files or can use OpenZeppelin or Moralis. Also you can go through the doc which I have attached for a easier way to implement.
